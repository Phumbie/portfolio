					I started programming in 2018 and started professionally in august 2019. As a graduate of psychology
					with solid interest in technology, I have been able to find balance between having empathy for Users
					and tackling their needs by leveraging technological tools. In the course of my professional career
					I've worked with start Innovation Hub where I've worked on several projects, learned how to work in
					an agile team and also picking new tools as the task demands.In the course of my stay there , I was
					selected my PIND(Patnership Initiatives in the Niger Delta), to tutor and mentor selected members of
					the Project create programme in Front end development. Majority of them have gone on to get various
					jobs in the field. I was also selected to participate in the FSI Hackathon sponsored by Sterling
					bank where I lead a team(Aibug) of four to win the first price in the South-South geo -politcal
					zone.
